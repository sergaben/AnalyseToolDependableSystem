# CodeChecker

This small program allows you to check your code with a set of the most important software metrics. Such as, Halstead Complexity,
Cyclomatic Complexity, Number of Lines Of Code, etc...

However, it is important to take into account that by no means the results of these tests are an absolute truth and they should be taken
as a way to reflect upon the code.

## Getting Started

In order to run this project on your own environment you should have Java 8.# or above
